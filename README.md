get_traffic
===========

Sometimes you do not have root on the server. you can not install the tools like dstat or something like that.  
This script can give you the answer. You can change the unit by yourself.  
Just run it like  
`$ sh get_traffic.sh eth1`  
replace the eth1 by your own interface.
